# ---  README for Caleson  ---

Caleson is a set of tools useful for audio production. <br/>
It's a fork from Cadence (being developed by falkTX), using Python3 and Qt5.

Many things have been removed from the fork:
* Catia
* Claudia
* Catarina
* Jack-meters
* xy-controller
* Tab for managing Plugins PATHS
* Tab for managing default multimedia applications

It is still work in progress, no interest to test it for the moment.

### [Caleson-JackSettings](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio:Applications:Caleson-JackSettings)
Simple and easy-to-use configure dialog for jackdbus. <br/>
It can configure JACK's driver and engine parameters.

### [Caleson-Logs](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio:Applications:Caleson-Logs)
