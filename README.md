# ---  README for Caleson  ---

Caleson is a set of tools useful for audio production. <br/>
It's being developed by falkTX, using Python3 and Qt5.

The tools share the same base source code, so most of them look quite similar (which is intentional). <br/>
Also, lots of custom widgets were coded when needed (like pixmapdial, pixmapkeyboard and systray). <br/>
They can be re-used in other projects. Contact the author if you need help on that.


===== DESCRIPTIONS =====
------------------------
Here's a brief description of the main tools:

### [Caleson](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio:Applications:Caleson)
The main app. It performs system checks, manages JACK, calls other tools and make system tweaks.

### [Caleson-JackSettings](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio:Applications:Caleson-JackSettings)
Simple and easy-to-use configure dialog for jackdbus. <br/>
It can configure JACK's driver and engine parameters.

### [Caleson-Logs](http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/KXStudio:Applications:Caleson-Logs)
Small tool that shows JACK and A2J logs in a multi-tab window. <br/>
The logs are viewed in a text box, making it easy to browse and extract status messages using copy and paste commands.
